mysql-cpp
=========
`mysql-cpp` is a type safe and injection safe C++ interface to MySQL. It uses
C++11 variadic templates to create and run prepared statements and
automatically converts the results from MySQL into the appropriate datatypes.

Type safe
---------
`mysql-cpp` uses type deduction to automatically convert and store the results
from MySQL.

    MySql connection("localhost", "user", "password");
    vector<tuple<string, int>> users;
    connection.runQuery(&users, "SELECT name, age FROM user");

`mysql-cpp` accomodates `NULL` values by sending tuples with `std::shared_ptr`
or `std::unique_ptr`. If a `NULL` is encountered with a non-`std::shared_ptr`
or non-`std::unique_ptr` data type, an exception is thrown.

    vector<tuple<string, shared_ptr<string>>> movies;
    connection.runQuery(&movies, "SELECT user, favorite_movie FROM user");
    for (const auto& movie: movies) {
        if (nullptr != get<1>(movie)) {
            cout << get<0>(movie) << " likes " << *get<1>(movie) << endl;
        } else {
            cout << get<0>(movie) << " has no favorite movie" << endl;
        }
    }

Other errors such as invalid output parameter size or incorrect number of bind
values will be detected at runtime and will throw an exception.

Injection safe
--------------
The queries generated by `mysql-cpp` use prepared statements, so you don't need
to worry about injection attacks. `mysql-cpp` will infer the types of the
objects you're sending and automatically create and run the prepared statement.

    int age = 29;
    string username = "brandon'; DROP TABLE user; -- ";
    connection->runCommand(
        "UPDATE user SET age = ? WHERE username = ?",
        age,
        username);
    connection->runQuery(
        &users,
        "SELECT name, age FROM user WHERE username = ?",
        username);
    assert(users.empty());
